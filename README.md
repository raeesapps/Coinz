Note that the commit "Coins get converted to gold instead of going to the wallet" is misleading. It is supposed to mean that coins that the player receives through a transfer get converted to gold instead of going to the wallet. Coins that a player receives through walking around a map go to the wallet and do not get converted to gold unless the player presses on the coin in the wallet.
